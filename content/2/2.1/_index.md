#### Prepare infrastructure

To perform this lab, we need to prepare the following steps to standardize infrastructure such as VPC, Security Group, Database RDS for Application and EC2 instance.

1. [Create VPC](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/2-prerequiste/2.1-createvpc/)
2. [Create Security Group for EC2](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/2-prerequiste/2.2-createsg/)
3. [Create Security Group for Database RDS](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/2-prerequiste/2.3-createsgdb/)
4. [Create Database Subnet Group](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/2-prerequiste/2.4-createdbsubnet/)
5. [Create Database Instance](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/3-createdbinstance/)
6. [Create EC2 instance](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/4-createec2/)
7. [Connect DB instance](https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/en/5-connectdb/)
